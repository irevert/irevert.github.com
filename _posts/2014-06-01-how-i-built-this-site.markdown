title: How I built this site

The initial steps are very simple.  Just followed the Jekyll getting
started documentation.


{% highlight bash %}

# create github repo: username.github.com and
# check it out

    
# create jekyll basic site
jekyll new .
    
# commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push
    
# from now on ... edit, commit and push
{% endhighlight %}
